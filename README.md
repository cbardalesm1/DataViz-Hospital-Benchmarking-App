Cluster Overview, regression Plot, Otmization and Sensitivity Analysis
Project Title: Florida Hospital Benchmarking – Efficiency Analysis and Optimization

Description:

This project is the second part of a Florida hospital benchmarking initiative. The first phase involved data cleaning, clustering hospitals based on operational characteristics, dimensionality reduction using Lasso regression for automated expense selection, and exploratory analysis—completed in Python.

In this second phase, the focus is on analyzing the relationship between the previously selected key expense variables and hospital revenue. The regression plots are developed to visualize the average expected revenue based on these key expense patterns. These plots are not intended as predictive models but are used to understand the typical revenue- pre selected expense dynamics.

Optimization is performed using efficiency frontier modeling to recommend optimal expense configurations that can enhance operational efficiency compared to peer hospitals.

A sensitivity analysis introduces "what-if" scenarios to evaluate how adjustments in selected expenses may impact performance relative to benchmarks.
